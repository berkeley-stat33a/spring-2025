title: "4) Matrices"
---


## 📖 Lecture

We continue describing more atomic objects such as arrays (N-dimensional objects) and matrices (2-dimensional arrays).



## 🎯 Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Create simple matrices with `matrix()`
- Describe and give examples of matrix subsetting (subscripting, indexing)
- Explain in what sense a matrix is a 2-dimensional object
