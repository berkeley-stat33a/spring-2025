## ðŸ“– Lecture

In this week, we discuss __lists__, which are the most generic kind of data container in R.



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Describe in what sense a list is a one-dimensional object
- Describe in what sense a list is like a "train with wagons"
- provide an example of subsetting with single brackets (e.g. `lis[index]`)
- provide an example of subsetting with double brackets, and a single element `lis[[index]]`)
- provide a manipulation example with the dollar operator (e.g. `lis$wagon`)
