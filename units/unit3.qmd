title: "3) More about Vectors"
---


## ðŸ“– Lecture

We continue describing more aspects about vectors, specifically the so-called subsetting also known as indexing or subscripting.

- __subsetting__ (aka subscripting, subindexing, indexing): the use of single/double brackets to subset (i.e. subscript, index) elements of a vector.



## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Use brackets to subset elements of a vector
- Provide an example of numeric subsetting
- Provide an example of logical subsetting
- Provide an example of character subsetting
